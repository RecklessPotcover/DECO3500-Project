# Timely Elderly Fall Rescue Network

This is a project for DECO3500 - Social & Mobile Computing. It aims at sending timely rescue calls to volunteers when the elderly fall and facilitating volunteers to be instructed by medical staff remotely before they arrive.

# Designing and Prototyping Process
Documents conducted from the domain research, interviews, survey and questionnaire, low fidelity prototype with its evaluations, medium fidelity prototype with its evaluations, high fidelity prototype with its evaluations are shown in Wiki pages.

Individual work share for stand-up presentations, team meetings and other tasks are noted in the form of task tickets on the Issue page.

The low fidelity prototype is made on the Miro platform as the prototype is static and non-functional. Medium fidelity prototype is made on Adobe XD platform and that prototype are partially functional. The high fidelity prototype is made on the Figma platform and Unity platform with great dynamic effects displayed.

## Try it! (Prototype)
There are two parts of our final prototype, mobile app user interface with Figma and userflow simulation with Unity.

*Our core features, elderly and medical side UI are shown in this game. Use Google Chrome or Firefox for the best experience. Fullscreen mode is not recommended since there are UI and performance issue*
